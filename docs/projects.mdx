title: "Projects"
description: "The projects page displays a list of prospective, estimated, running actual, final actual, closed, and archived projects, in list or Kanban format. "

The list format display shows details like status, client, contact, owner, and estimates, as well as the date the project opened and the date range assigned to it. Displaying in this format allows for an overview of a variety of information relating to the project, which can be modified by clicking on the name of the project. Other aspects can be modified in the list display, such as status.

In the Kanban display, the informational details which are included in the prior list format are not displayedâ€”instead, projects are displayed in a Kanban board. Electronic Kanban allows for a lean, agile approach to project delivery, and the position of items on the Kanban board can be changed by dragging and dropping an item from one column to another as items progress through the delivery cycle.

Clicking on one of the project pages will bring you to project overview, which this guide has covered under the **project tab** section of the resources page guide.

Like the schedule we've seen earlier, there is a search option which can be used to find specific clients, people, or projects, as well as the option to include another filter of information (the '+' button)
