What does it take today to build out three versions of a schedule, plus revisions, with multiple estimates, each version with a completely different script, then assemble a team, manage Production, get everyone's timesheets, handle releases and contracts, bill the client, revise the bill to the client, bill the first 50% to the client, wrap the job, complete completion reports and archive to nearline. And then to tape. Twice.

We can help you do all that. And a lot more.

## Welcome

Rangeworks systems are designed to improve productivity by streamlining your workload.

Our solutions are built to address specific needs, identified via in-depth discovery and detailed analysis of the projected environment.

Instead of creating another generic tool, we built a flexible platform that delivers core functionality - and then added a customizable layer that can be configured to deliver exactly on the needs of all end-users.

## Core components

### Project management

Create projects and schedules, generate reports and view / edit your various assignments and responsibilities - all from one globally accessible tool.

Schedules for individual components can be directly associated with overarching programs or campaigns.

### Resource management

Sophisticated tools to manage your teams. Rapid team-building. Real-time visibility into resource allocation at organization, department and team levels.

High levels of detail enable you the ability to ascertain workload so you can make informed decisions based on real-time data.

### Digital asset management

Manage files that are in production (work in progress), as an archive of approved assets - and as a delivery system for customers and third parties.

Assets can be stored at department or project levels and managed for usage rights, expirations and accessibility.

## Integrations

We speak Google docs, GCP, AWS, Dropbox, Alfresco, Onelogin, CAS, Adobe, Microsoft, Quickbooks, Xero - you name it, chances are we've connected to it.

And if we haven't, we're more than happy to take a look and work out how to get ourselves connected.

## Customization

The devil really is in the details.

Most workflow tools are built to accommodate the widest possible audience.

These tools work well - for the most part - but they often force users to work across multiple systems, or adopt methods and techniques that don't always fit with the way the organization works now.
