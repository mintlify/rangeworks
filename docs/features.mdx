Start with the basics and let the system grow with you, or build your perfect solution and maximize efficiency from day one.

It's entirely up to you.

## Key features

### Project overviews

Your project's home page. Everything that's going on right now, updated in real time. Includes everything you need to stay up-to-date and on-track.

### Team

Fluid and flexible. Team members can be added or removed at any time. Working with external partners? Range Works let's you control exactly what they can see or do.

### Scheduling

Work the way you want with calendar, timeline, plan and resourcing views. Build and share multiple versions of the schedule quickly and easily.

### Tasks

Build and assign tasks for you and your team. Set deadlines and monitor progress. Comments and attachments keep the conversation going.

### Notes

Briefs, client meeting notes, feedback - organized and stored in notebooks for easy and secure access. Share notes with the team or keep them private.

### Forms

Say goodbye to PDF forms. Build out custom forms to capture exactly what you need. Duplicate a form to cut down on data entry and redundancy.

### Files

Project assets at your fingertips. Support for drag and drop, custom-metadata, usage and expirations. Stay consistent with default folder structures added to every project.

### Campaigns

Working on a big campaign or program? Build a parent project and add as many sub-projects as you need. See the big picture and all the little ones too.

### Integrations

Got an existing system you need to integrate with? We already work with a lot of systems out of the box and can connect to anything with a ReST API.
