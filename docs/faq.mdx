## Q&A

Click the questions below or feel free to drop us a line.

<Accordion title="How long does it take to design and build a system?">

It varies. A simple system with minimal integration and limited customization can be up and running in a couple of weeks. A custom developed system with lots of features can take several months to design, develop and deploy.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How much does it cost?">

It all depends. As each system is built to order, it's tough to say exactly how much it's going to cost.

Our systems are configured a la carte, so you only pay for what you actually need. We can utilize your existing storage if we're able to access it, further reducing overall cost.

<Accordion title="How do we get started?">

Typically, we schedule a call and / or demo with your team and walk through the tools. If the fit is good, we'll schedule a follow-up to discuss specifics of the engagement and build a sandbox system so that stakeholders can start to get a sense of what's possible.

The discovery process can take as little as an hour and as much as a week. From this we develop a feature set and roadmap along with a detailed statement of work document and estimate.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why no demo system or free version?">

What we offer is a custom-built solution. If you need something relatively straight-forward, there are dozens of systems on the market today that will likely fit your needs. Our expertise is in building one-of-a-kind tools for creative production environments such as design studios, corp. marketing teams, post-production facilities and ad agencies.

In our experience, each of these has a number of similarities but it's the differences that we're interested in.

## Still not satisfied?

We're more than happy to chat and see if we're a good fit. And even if it isn't, we live and breathe this stuff and can potentially steer you towards some off-the-shelf solutions that might work for you. If you've been looking around for a while, you'll know the market is pretty crowded.
